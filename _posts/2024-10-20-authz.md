Authorisation is a critical component of modern application security, and yet it can be complex to implement across different systems. While authentication verifies who a user is, authorisation ensures that users can only access the data and perform the actions they’re allowed to. However, despite its importance, many implementations fall short of providing the level of security needed for complex projects.

In many cases, authorisation checks are performed within the backend application code, separate from the data they are meant to protect. This approach has significant downsides, creating opportunities for mistakes and inconsistencies between services with varying degrees of security that interact with the same data.

This post doesn't propose a solution but rather sheds light on some of the flaws in current authorisation models. I will be using a hypothetical GitHub-like system as an example to highlight the fact that relying on application-level checks leaves serious security concerns.

To illustrate these points, let’s look at a typical CRUD application model and focus on two specific endpoints:

- `POST /repository` This endpoint creates a repository and returns its ID.
- `GET /repository/{ID}` This endpoint retrieves the file and folder structure of a specific repository.

Each of these endpoints would require distinct authorisation actions. Let’s take a closer look at each one individually.

### Create a repository record

In a create scenario, the backend application creates a record in the domain database and updates the authorisation service to associate the record ID with the user ID.

It’s up to the application to ensure that the data store supports transactions, with the write to the authorisation service being part of the atomic operation. This means that if writing to the authorisation service fails, the write to the database should be rolled back. The application must handle atomicity failures correctly.

In this example, we can use a two-phase commit approach. However, an architecture might also implement [Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture){:target="_blank"} to capture write events to the domain database and maintain tuple relations in the authorisation service. Alternatively, in a [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html){:target="_blank"} architecture, the application could send authorisation commands that are then recorded in the authorisation service. Regardless of the approach, the core problem this post aims to highlight remains the same.

### Reading a repository record

To read a single repository record, the application first checks permissions by asking the authorisation service whether a given user is on the list of users allowed to perform read action on that record.

Again, it is up to the application to ensure that it understands and conforms to the response from the authorisation service. In the first call, Alice wants to read the record with ID 1, and the authorisation service permits that access. However, if the application has a bug in processing the authorisation decision, it could incorrectly reject the call.

The second example illustrates access denial, where Alice requests record ID 2. In this case, the misinterpretation of the denial is even worse where the application might query the database and return the result, even though the authorisation service has denied the access request. This inconsistency highlights the risks associated with relying on application-level authorisation checks.

### Is this secure?

Considering these concerns, we need to reflect on what they mean for the security of the system. One notable implementation in this space is [AuthZed](https://authzed.com){:target="_blank"}, which has done an impressive job with Google Zanzibar-inspired SpiceDB. I have used it professionally and have solved many complex scenarios that we had abstracted from our database.

On the AuthZed landing page, they demonstrate a scenario where a spaceship requests permission to land on a planet. In this scenario, one spaceship is denied landing, while another is granted access.

However, if the spaceship has a bug in its code, it might land even when the authorisation service denied its permission request, or it might not land when it was granted permission. This inconsistency not only illustrates the risks associated with application-level checks but also highlights that an application could intentionally ignore the authorisation decision altogether.

The question of whether this design is secure depends on the domain of the problem we are trying to solve. If we are working with a highly regulated product and keeping the permission checks within the application—where the application can choose whether or not to abide by those checks—this approach is undeniably insecure.

### What are we guarding?

We use an authorisation service to keep data secure and ensure that only those with the proper permissions can access it. In other words, we are guarding against unauthorised access to records. So why aren’t we placing boundaries directly around our data? If our hypothetical GitHub backend application is performing the authorisation checks and then querying the database based on those decisions, the protections are only around the backend application, not the data itself.

To illustrate, if we think of the application as the spaceship and the data as the planet, it becomes clear that we need robust protections for the planet. If the spaceship decides to ignore the authorisation decision, there should still be a security layer in place to prevent unauthorised calls and protect the planet.

If we were to create another backend application that has access to the same database but lacks authorisation checks or has faulty checks, that means the data is left unprotected.

Some databases come equipped with Row-Level Security (RLS) features, which provide a more robust method for protecting against unauthorised access. However, these RLS implementations often lack the advanced relational capabilities found in Zanzibar-inspired products.

### Conclusion

In summary, authorisation remains a complex and vital aspect of application security, with various methods available, including role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control. A significant challenge in these approaches is the difficulty of implementing robust authorisation mechanisms directly around the data itself. While application-level checks provide a layer of security, they could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if not managed carefully.

Areas of concern in current authorisation designs include:

- Application-level decision handling: Errors in decision-making can lead to unauthorised access or mistakenly deny access to authorised users.
- Authorisation relation writes: Blocking requests until writes to the domain database, and to the authorisation service is committed.
- Multiple round trips and latency: Some type of requests could require an application to perform multiple round trips to authorisation to process a single domain operation.
