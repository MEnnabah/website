Authorization is a critical component of application security, and it's becoming increasingly challenging to implement as application use cases evolve. In my work, I was lucky enough to tackle this challenge, where the requirements involved organizational hierarchy, an invitation system, and access restrictions.

Initially, we built a basic authorization system in PostgreSQL, but as the requirements evolved, the design quickly began to fall apart. We had to account for scenarios like temporarily accessible records or records that are accessible only by certain users. So we decided to explore other solutions.

Google published a white paper explaining their internal authorization system, [Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/zanzibar-googles-consistent-global-authorization-system/){:target="_blank"}, which has inspired many open-source implementations. Out of these, we decided to go with [SpiceDB](https://authzed.com/spicedb){:target="_blank"}. The idea of Zanzibar is a distributed authorization system that services can speak to, and let it know when records are created/updated/deleted by who. Later, you query the system to get an authorization decision.

In many cases, authorization checks are performed within the backend application code, separate from the data they are meant to protect. This approach has downsides, creating opportunities for mistakes and inconsistencies between services with varying degrees of security that interact with the same data.

This post highlights some of the flaws in current authorization models. I'll use a hypothetical Dropbox-like system as an example to illustrate the risks of relying solely on application-level checks, which can leave serious security concerns.

To illustrate these points, let’s look at a typical CRUD application model and focus on two specific endpoints:

- `POST /file` This endpoint creates a Dropbox file record and returns its ID.
- `GET /file/{ID}` This endpoint retrieves a file record by its ID.

Each of these endpoints would require distinct authorization actions.

### Create a file record

In a create scenario, the backend application creates a record in the domain database and updates the authorization service to associate the record ID with the user ID.

This is the part where the application needs to notify the authorization service about mutations. It’s up to the application to ensure that the writes to the domain database and the authorisation service are atomic. This means that if writing to the authorization service fails, the write to the database should be rolled back.

In this example, we can use a two-phase commit approach. However, an architecture might also implement [Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture){:target="_blank"} to capture write events to the domain database and maintain tuple relations in the authorization service. Alternatively, in a [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html){:target="_blank"} architecture, the application could send authorization commands that are then recorded in the authorization service. Regardless of the approach, the core problem this post aims to highlight remains the same.

### Reading a file record

To read a single file record, the application first checks permissions by asking the authorization service whether a given user is on the list of users allowed to perform read action on that record.

![Read Single Record](/assets/post240615/read-single-record.png)

Again, it is up to the application to ensure that it understands and conforms to the response from the authorization service. In the first call, Alice wants to read the record with ID 1, and the authorization service permits that access. However, if the application has a bug in processing the authorization decision, it could incorrectly reject the call.

The second example illustrates access denial, where Alice requests record ID 2. In this case, the misinterpretation of the denial is even worse where the application might query the database and return the result, even though the authorization service has denied the access request. This inconsistency highlights the risks associated with relying on application-level authorization checks.

### Is this secure?

On the [AuthZed](https://authzed.com){:target="_blank"} landing page, the creators of SpiceDB, they demonstrate a permission system with a spaceship request authorization decision to land on a planet. In the example, one spaceship is denied landing, and the other is granted access.

However, if the spaceship has a bug in its code, it might land even when the authorization service denied its permission request, or it might not land when it was granted permission. This inconsistency not only illustrates the risks associated with application-level checks but also highlights that an application could intentionally ignore the authorization decision altogether.

The question of whether this design is secure depends on the domain of the problem we are trying to solve. If we are working with a highly regulated product and keeping the permission checks within the application—where the application can choose whether or not to abide by those checks— I think this approach is undeniably insecure.

### What are we guarding?

We use an authorization service to keep data secure and ensure that only those with the proper permissions can access it. In other words, we are guarding against unauthorized access to records. So why aren’t we placing boundaries directly around our data? Our hypothetical Dropbox backend application is performing the authorization checks and then querying the database based on those decisions, the protections are only around the backend application, not the data itself.

To illustrate, if we think of the application as the spaceship and the data as the planet, it becomes clear that we need robust protections for the planet. If the spaceship decides to ignore the authorization decision, there should still be a security layer in place to prevent unauthorized calls and protect the planet. If Dropbox decided to build another backend service in addition to what they currently have, that new backend application would not only need to re-implement authorization checks but also ensure they are implemented correctly and match the behavior of the existing system.

To put this in the context of today's era of complex access control requirements, let's say our Dropbox implementation consists of the following permissions:

- Read and write access by the creator of a file.
- Read and write access by users who have read and write access to the parent folder.
- Invite users with read-only permissions.
- Invite users with read and write permissions.
- Invite an organization to a file/folder, and inherently, all users within that organization get the specified permissions.


Some databases support Row-Level Security (RLS), which is a more robust method for protecting against unauthorized access. However, these RLS implementations often lack the advanced relational capabilities that Zanzibar-inspired products are solving. RLS is designed mainly in the context of database SQL statements. This is an example of how RLS looks:

```SQL
CREATE POLICY folder_owner_can_read ON folder
AS RESTRICTIVE
FOR SELECT
USING ( current_user = folder.owner_user_id )
```

What this policy essentially does is append an implicit `WHERE` clause to the query to filter records with the owner ID matching the current context user name.

Now, let's say our permission requirements evolved, and we need to allow a group of users from a specific team to be able to read a given folder, and part of these users have read and write access, allowing them to modify files in that folder. Imagine how complicated it would be to create policies for every possible read situation, or how impossible it would be to allow for a nested organizational hierarchy. There's a clear need for a database-level authorization system that can cope with today's (and hopefully future) requirements. This could be narrowed down to what Zanzibar addresses: finding a relationship chain between a record and a user.

### Conclusion

In summary, authorization is a complex and essential aspect of application security. Various models exist, including role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control. A significant challenge across these approaches is the difficulty of implementing robust authorization mechanisms directly around the data we're trying to protect. While application-level checks provide some security, they can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

I am very passionate about authorization and identity and access management. If you have questions or would like to discuss this further, please feel free to reach out.
