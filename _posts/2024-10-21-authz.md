Authorization is a critical component of application security, and it's becoming increasingly challenging to implement as application use cases evolve. In my work, I was lucky enough to tackle this challenge, where the requirements involved organizational hierarchy, an invitation system, and access restrictions to specific records.

Initially, we built a basic authorization system in PostgreSQL, but as the requirements evolved, the design quickly began to fall apart. We had to account for scenarios like temporarily publicly accessible records and roles applicable only to specific records or entities. So we decided to explore other solutions.

Google published a white paper on their internal authorization system, Zanzibar, which has inspired many open-source implementations. Out of these, we decided to go with [SpiceDB](https://authzed.com/spicedb){:target="_blank"}. The idea of Zanzibar is a distributed authorization system that services can speak to, and let it know when records are created/updated/deleted by who. Later, you query the system to get an authorization decision.

In many cases, authorization checks are performed within the backend application code, separate from the data they are meant to protect. This approach has downsides, creating opportunities for mistakes and inconsistencies between services with varying degrees of security that interact with the same data.

This post highlights some of the flaws in current authorization models. I'll use a hypothetical GitHub-like system as an example to illustrate the risks of relying solely on application-level checks, which can leave serious security concerns.

To illustrate these points, let’s look at a typical CRUD application model and focus on two specific endpoints:

- `POST /repository` This endpoint creates a repository and returns its ID.
- `GET /repository/{ID}` This endpoint retrieves the file and folder structure of a repository.

Each of these endpoints would require distinct authorization actions.

### Create a repository record

In a create scenario, the backend application creates a record in the domain database and updates the authorization service to associate the record ID with the user ID.

This is the part where the application needs to notify Zanzibar about mutations. It’s up to the application to ensure that the data store supports transactions, with the write to the authorization service being part of the atomic operation. This means that if writing to the authorization service fails, the write to the database should be rolled back. The application must handle atomicity failures correctly.

In this example, we can use a two-phase commit approach. However, an architecture might also implement [Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture){:target="_blank"} to capture write events to the domain database and maintain tuple relations in the authorization service. Alternatively, in a [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html){:target="_blank"} architecture, the application could send authorization commands that are then recorded in the authorization service. Regardless of the approach, the core problem this post aims to highlight remains the same.

### Reading a repository record

To read a single repository record, the application first checks permissions by asking the authorization service whether a given user is on the list of users allowed to perform read action on that record.

Again, it is up to the application to ensure that it understands and conforms to the response from the authorization service. In the first call, Alice wants to read the record with ID 1, and the authorization service permits that access. However, if the application has a bug in processing the authorization decision, it could incorrectly reject the call.

The second example illustrates access denial, where Alice requests record ID 2. In this case, the misinterpretation of the denial is even worse where the application might query the database and return the result, even though the authorization service has denied the access request. This inconsistency highlights the risks associated with relying on application-level authorization checks.

### Is this secure?

On the [AuthZed](https://authzed.com){:target="_blank"} landing page, the creators of SpiceDB, they demonstrate a permission system with a spaceship request authorization decision to land on a planet. In the example, one spaceship is denied landing, and the other is granted access.

However, if the spaceship has a bug in its code, it might land even when the authorization service denied its permission request, or it might not land when it was granted permission. This inconsistency not only illustrates the risks associated with application-level checks but also highlights that an application could intentionally ignore the authorization decision altogether.

The question of whether this design is secure depends on the domain of the problem we are trying to solve. If we are working with a highly regulated product and keeping the permission checks within the application—where the application can choose whether or not to abide by those checks— I think this approach is undeniably insecure.

### What are we guarding?

We use an authorization service to keep data secure and ensure that only those with the proper permissions can access it. In other words, we are guarding against unauthorized access to records. So why aren’t we placing boundaries directly around our data? If our hypothetical GitHub backend application is performing the authorization checks and then querying the database based on those decisions, the protections are only around the backend application, not the data itself.

To illustrate, if we think of the application as the spaceship and the data as the planet, it becomes clear that we need robust protections for the planet. If the spaceship decides to ignore the authorization decision, there should still be a security layer in place to prevent unauthorized calls and protect the planet.

If we were to create another backend application that has access to the same database but lacks authorization checks or has faulty checks, that means the data is left unprotected.

Some databases support Row-Level Security (RLS), which is a more robust method for protecting against unauthorized access. However, these RLS implementations often lack the advanced relational capabilities that Zanzibar-inspired products are solving.

### Conclusion

In summary, authorization is a complex and essential aspect of application security. Various models exist, including role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control. A significant challenge across these approaches is the difficulty of implementing robust authorization mechanisms directly around the data we're trying to protect. While application-level checks provide some security, they can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
