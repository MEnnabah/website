I work as a software engineer based in Dubai.

I mainly develop native iOS and macOS applications, and my recent work scope has expanded into multiple UI development frameworks (i.e. Xamarin, Flutter and React Native).

Recently, I started to be an active contributor to Swift and its tools.

# My work

I worked on many project, here are the interesting ones.

#### SecureCheckIn
SecureCheckIn is proof-of-presence mobile SDK that leverages BLE to prevent GPS location spoofing. It lets customers to define a tracking identifier and then is sent to a targeted Bluetooth device, the device generates a verified signature as a proof of presence, and then it's sent back to the mobile app.

#### Catch
[Catch][CatchApp] is mobile app for users to engage with DOOH (Digital out-of-home) media. It uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to stream content from nearby physical screens to the app. The app is built on top of SecureCheckIn libraries.

#### Dapi
dapi.com acts as a bridge between mobile apps and banks in countries without [open banking][OpenBanking]. Banking access to mobile apps is enabled by reverse engineering banks APIs, unifying them and providing them as a mobile SDK.
[Dapi SDK][DapiSDK] predates Swift's ABI stability, and is built as a pre-compiled binary with Objective-C.

#### Dayra
Money transfer app based in Cairo. It then got acquired by Dapi and became a SaaS company. Dayra is a YC Startup School funded.
